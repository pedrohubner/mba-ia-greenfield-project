## Decisions Detail

### phase-03-videos/TD-01

**Recommendation:** it is the queue the NestJS docs describe, and it already has the retry/backoff, stalled-job recovery and non-retryable failure semantics that TD-13 needs. Writing those by hand is what makes B and C cost more. The cost is one Redis container. B is the honest alternative if avoiding new infrastructure matters more than framework alignment: it removes the dual write, but the NestJS integration has to be built by hand.
**Libraries:** @nestjs/bullmq, bullmq

### phase-03-videos/TD-02

**Recommendation:** it is the only option where the bytes go from the client straight to storage with no server of ours in between, and resume comes from S3 itself (`ListParts`). That covers both "sem passar pela API" and "retomar em caso de falha" without a new container. The API keeps authorization and draft registration, because every step except the part `PUT`s goes through it.
**Libraries:** @aws-sdk/client-s3, @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner

### phase-03-videos/TD-03

**Recommendation:** with these limits: max size **10 GiB** (validated at initiate from the declared size and re-checked at complete with `HeadObject`). Part size **64 MiB** (→ ~160 parts for 10GB, well inside S3's 10,000-part and 5MiB-minimum limits). Part URLs signed in batches, with a short TTL (e.g., 1h) so a leaked URL expires soon. Accepted MIME types follow TD-09. Drafts stuck in `pending_upload` past the storage expiry window are deleted by a repeatable cleanup job on the same queue (TD-01). B adds per-part load on the API and still has to call `ListParts` to be correct, so A wins.
**Libraries:** —

**Revisions:**
- 2026-10-08 — Initiate contract: the request accepts an optional `title`; when absent, the draft title defaults to the original filename without its extension (sanitized, truncated to the column's max length). Title editing remains Phase 04. Rationale: resolves AMB-1 from `phase-03-videos` validation — the download `Content-Disposition` (TD-11) needs a title from draft creation.

### phase-03-videos/TD-04

**Recommendation:** everything stays behind the API's authorization while visibility rules (Phase 04) don't exist yet, and keying by `videoId` (not filename) avoids collisions by construction. If listing performance later needs stable thumbnail URLs, Phase 07 can add a public prefix/bucket without moving the originals. Buckets are created idempotently at startup by a one-shot `mc` init service in compose (or by the API on boot); either is an implementation detail.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-05

**Recommendation:** it respects the project's service-name rule for every real connection and keeps the environment reproducible with `docker compose up` alone. It relies on SigV4 presigning being purely local, which makes the second "public" client free. **Decided refinement:** Two refinements so presigned URLs also work *inside* the Compose network. (1) URLs consumed by a container — the worker handing the source URL to ffprobe/ffmpeg (TD-08) — are signed with the **internal** client (`STORAGE_ENDPOINT`), never the public one. (2) In the test environment `STORAGE_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` points to the internal endpoint, so integration/e2e suites running in the `nestjs-api` container can fetch signed URLs and assert real `206 Partial Content` responses. `STORAGE_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000` is the single deliberate exception to the `CLAUDE.md` service-name rule: it is consumed by the browser on the host, never by a container.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-06

**Recommendation:** the API already performs the completion, so enqueuing there gives validation, ordering and idempotency (`jobId = videoId`) in one place, without coupling to a storage-specific notification feature.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-07

**Recommendation:** it gives the separate container the diagram describes and keeps FFmpeg out of the API's resources, while reusing the existing TypeORM entities and config layer instead of duplicating them. Worker concurrency should start low (1–2 jobs), since each job runs FFmpeg. **Decided refinement:** One development image with `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` installed is shared by the `nestjs-api` and `video-worker` services (instead of two Dockerfile targets). Tests run inside the `nestjs-api` container (`nestjs-project/CLAUDE.md`), so the processing integration tests must be able to execute the real binaries — the phase brief forbids mocking what the Compose infra can run. Test videos are generated at test time by ffmpeg itself (`-f lavfi -i testsrc`), so no binary fixtures are committed.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-08

**Recommendation:** two well-defined commands don't justify a wrapper (and the main one is deprecated), and reading over HTTP with Range requests avoids moving 10GB through the worker for an operation that needs only headers and one frame. Thumbnail policy: frame at ~10% of duration (clamped for very short videos), JPEG, max width 1280 px keeping aspect ratio, stored at the `auto.jpg` key from TD-04.
**Libraries:** —

**Revisions:**
- 2026-10-08 — Persisted metadata is a fixed set of typed columns on the video: `duration_seconds`, `width`, `height`, `video_codec`, `audio_codec` (nullable), `container_format`, `bitrate`, `size_bytes`. Rationale: resolves AMB-2 from `phase-03-videos` validation — "metadados" in the capability was unspecified.

### phase-03-videos/TD-09

**Recommendation:** the plan defines processing as "extração de duração e metadados" + thumbnail, and progressive streaming of MP4/WebM over Range/206 already meets "reprodução sem download completo". B or C can be added later as a new job type without changing the upload contract.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-10

**Recommendation:** it is the only option that is short, non-enumerable and DB-guaranteed unique without a dependency. 64 bits of randomness plus a unique index makes conflicts impossible in practice and impossible to persist in fact.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-11

**Recommendation:** storage handles Range/206 and Content-Disposition natively, so the API only authorizes and signs. A JSON response works with the strict-BFF decision already in place. Playback TTL should be long (hours) and the download TTL short (minutes). Access in this phase is limited to `ready` videos; visibility (public/unlisted) and anonymous viewing rules belong to Phases 04/05 and will plug into the same endpoints. **Decided refinement:** Authorization in this phase: `playback` and `download` are allowed **only to the authenticated owner of the video's channel**, and only when `processing_status = ready`. Every video in Phase 03 is a draft (TD-12), and visibility/anonymous viewing belong to Phases 04/05, which will widen access on these same endpoints.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-12

**Recommendation:** keeping technical and editorial state separate lets Phase 03 own `processing_status` completely and Phase 04 add publication rules without changing the worker's state machine. Transitions are enforced in the domain (only legal moves allowed; the worker only moves `uploaded → processing → ready | failed`). **Decided refinement:** Mapping to the phase brief's lifecycle "rascunho → processando → pronto/erro": *rascunho* = `publication_status = draft` (set at initiate, the whole of Phase 03); *processando* = `processing_status` in `uploaded`/`processing`; *pronto* = `ready`; *erro* = `failed`. `pending_upload` is the state while the multipart upload is still in progress.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-13

**Recommendation:** the queue's attempts/backoff and `UnrecoverableError` separate transient from permanent failures with no custom code, and keeping the original makes every failure diagnosable and recoverable later. B can be added when a real need for self-service retry appears; C trades irreversible data loss for storage savings that don't matter at this stage.
**Libraries:** —

## Inherited Decisions Detail

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/config) — Official, core-team-maintained, guaranteed NestJS 11 compatibility. The `registerAs()` factory pattern solves the TypeORM CLI sharing problem: the factory function can be imported as a plain function by `data-source.ts` while also serving as a DI injection token inside NestJS. Building a custom module recreates solved functionality; third-party packages carry maintenance risk.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs/config@^4.x`

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Option A (Joi) — First-class integration with `@nestjs/config` via `validationSchema`, requiring zero custom wiring. Handles string-to-number coercion natively. Using a different tool for env validation vs. request validation is reasonable — env config is validated once at startup, DTOs are validated per-request. Zod is elegant but adds a third validation paradigm to the project.

**Libraries:** `joi@^17.x`

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Option B (Namespaced/grouped with registerAs) — The project roadmap explicitly calls for auth, email, and storage in upcoming phases. Namespaced configs provide clear file boundaries per domain, typed injection via `ConfigType<typeof databaseConfig>`, and natural scalability. The `registerAs()` factory is dual-purpose: DI token inside NestJS and plain importable function for `data-source.ts`. Initial files for Phase 01: `src/config/database.config.ts`, `src/config/app.config.ts`.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Option A (Shared registerAs factory) — Natural outcome of choosing `@nestjs/config` with `registerAs`. The factory is already callable by design. `data-source.ts` imports it, calls `dotenv.config()`, then calls the factory. Zero duplication, minimal code, no extra abstraction.

**Libraries:** `dotenv` (transitive via `@nestjs/config`)

### phase-02-auth/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Argon2id — For a greenfield project in 2026, Argon2id is the OWASP-recommended choice. The native build dependency is a one-time Docker setup cost. The project has no legacy constraints favoring bcrypt. OWASP minimum: 19MiB memory, 2 iterations.

**Libraries:** `argon2@^0.41.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/passport) — The project plan includes only email/password auth for now, but the plugin architecture costs little and future phases may add social login. Aligns with official NestJS docs, making onboarding and maintenance easier.

**Note:** Decision deliberately diverged from the Recommendation during implementation — custom guards were preferred over `@nestjs/passport` to keep the dependency surface smaller; social login is not on the near-term roadmap, so the plugin-architecture benefit did not justify the extra abstraction layer.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs/jwt@^11.0.0`

### phase-02-auth/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Option A (Refresh Token Rotation) — Provides the strongest security model with automatic theft detection. The DB write overhead is acceptable for a video platform (auth refresh is infrequent vs. video operations). PostgreSQL is already in the stack, so no new infrastructure needed. Race conditions can be mitigated with a short grace period for the old token.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Option B (Random Opaque Tokens in DB) — Revocability is important: when a user requests a new password reset, previous tokens should be invalidated. The DB table is trivial to implement, and the tokens table can also serve future needs (e.g., API keys). Keeps email tokens decoupled from the JWT auth system.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-05

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs-modules/mailer) — Best NestJS integration with minimal boilerplate. Supports SMTP (matching the architecture diagram), works with MailHog/Mailpit for local development without external dependencies, and scales to any SMTP provider in production. Template engine support (Handlebars) simplifies email formatting. No vendor lock-in.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs-modules/mailer@^2.x`, `handlebars@^4.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-06

**Recommendation:** Option A (class-validator + class-transformer) — This is a backend-only project (no shared schemas with frontend), so Zod's single-source-of-truth advantage is less impactful. class-validator is the documented NestJS approach, and the project already uses decorators extensively (TypeORM entities, NestJS DI). Fewer integration surprises with NestJS 11.

**Libraries:** `class-validator@^0.14.x`, `class-transformer@^0.5.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-07

**Recommendation:** Option A (Custom Domain Exception Filter) — Provides machine-readable error codes that the Next.js frontend can switch on, without the overhead of RFC 9457's URI-based type system. The project is single-consumer (first-party frontend), so a simple `{ statusCode, error, message }` format with domain codes balances clarity and simplicity. The custom filter cost is low — two small files.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-08

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/throttler) — Native NestJS integration is decisive: the guard system allows scoping rate limiting to `AuthModule` only via module-level `APP_GUARD`, with `@SkipThrottle()` for exemptions. The project is single-instance with no distributed requirements, so in-memory storage is sufficient. Using express-rate-limit would bypass NestJS's DI and guard lifecycle for no clear benefit.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs/throttler@^6.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-09

**Recommendation:** Option B (Opaque) — Since DB lookup is mandatory (TD-03), JWT signature adds no security value. Opaque tokens are shorter, leak no data, and are simpler to generate.

**Note:** Decision deliberately diverged from the Recommendation — JWT was kept to reuse the access-token signing/verification infrastructure (`@nestjs/jwt`), trading token size and base64-readability for a single token format across the codebase.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs/jwt@^11.0.0`

### phase-02-auth/TD-10

**Recommendation:** Option A — The platform is a video sharing service with URL-based channel handles. A strict `[a-z0-9_]` allowlist is the simplest and most portable choice: no extra dependencies, no edge cases around hyphen positioning, and the `user_<random>` fallback provides a valid handle even for extreme email prefixes. Hyphens can always be added in a future iteration if user feedback justifies it.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Architectural fit.** The strict-BFF model in `next-frontend-config-base/TD-03` already nominates the Route Handler as the only NestJS caller; cookie-based sessions are the natural match, and Auth.js's framework adds layers between the BFF and the cookie that buy nothing because the backend is the auth authority — Auth.js's value (DB adapters, OAuth providers, magic-link, `getServerSession` helpers) is mostly unused in this configuration. (2) **Smaller blast radius.** A ~50-LOC session helper is grep-friendly, debuggable, and test-friendly via the existing MSW+BFF integration test pattern; a misconfigured Auth.js callback is a longer fault-isolation loop. (3) **Compatibility with Next.js 16 / React 19.** Built-in `next/headers` `cookies()` is the canonical primitive both runtimes already use; Auth.js v5 versions track Next.js majors with a lag, adding compatibility risk that Option A does not have. Option C is rejected as unsafe (`localStorage` for refresh tokens) and architecturally regressive (loses RSC personalization).
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Defense in depth on the cookie content** — `httpOnly` blocks JS, encryption blocks accidental log/proxy inspection; the marginal cost is one ~3KB dep. (2) **Single cookie to manage** simplifies logout (one `session.destroy()` call) and avoids the orphan-cookie failure mode of Option A. (3) **Room to carry minimal user metadata** (`userId`, `email`, `channelSlug`) lets `app/layout.tsx` RSC render the authenticated chrome (avatar, channel name) without a per-render `/auth/me` round-trip — Phase 04+ gains compound here. Option A is a viable downgrade if the team rejects `iron-session` for any reason; the migration A→B (or B→A) is a one-Route-Handler refactor with no test changes downstream because the BFF interface is unchanged. Option C is rejected: it solves a problem (server-side revocation) the project does not have at the cost of infrastructure the project does not own.
**Libraries:** iron-session

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-03

**Recommendation:** The single-flight detail is non-trivial and goes in the helper from day one — tested by MSW with a "two concurrent intercepted upstream calls; one refresh expected" assertion. Option B's client-driven pattern is rejected because it doesn't replace Option A (RSC still needs server-side refresh) — adopting B means doing both. Option C's pre-emptive timer is rejected because the failure modes (multiple tabs, sleep/wake) outweigh the latency saving and force a `"use client"` shell near the root.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Decoupled from TD-05** — works with Route Handlers OR Server Actions; the form code does not change if TD-05 is revisited later. (2) **Aligned with shadcn's canonical form primitive** — the project already commits to `radix-nova` shadcn (`components.json`); `npx shadcn@latest add form` produces react-hook-form wrappers; choosing react-hook-form means using the supported primitive instead of hand-rolling around it. (3) **Zod-first developer ergonomics match the rest of the FE foundation** — `next-frontend-config-base/TD-01` chose Zod 4 for env; the same schemas-as-source-of-truth pattern carries to forms with zero new validator paradigm. Option B is rejected for impedance with shadcn's primitive and for over-investing in progressive-enhancement that the strict-BFF model does not require. Option C is rejected for the per-field boilerplate and the loss of client-side feedback on a project that values quick, type-safe form iteration.
**Libraries:** react-hook-form, @hookform/resolvers

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-05

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Strict-BFF alignment.** `next-frontend-config-base/TD-03` named Route Handlers as the BFF surface; Option A keeps every mutation visible under `app/api/**`. (2) **Test scaffold already exists** — `next-frontend/CLAUDE.md` § Testing and `next-frontend-msw-foundation` were authored for Route-Handlers-as-functions; Option A reuses them with zero invention. (3) **Single mutation surface** — Phase 02 sets the precedent for Phases 03–07; uniformity beats per-mutation idiom-picking when the cost of inconsistency compounds (Option C). Option B has real ergonomic appeal for the simplest forms but fragments the BFF surface and forces test-pattern reinvention; if the team later wants progressive enhancement for specific forms, the migration A→B is per-form and doesn't require touching unrelated routes — A is the safer default and the cheaper baseline.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-06

**Recommendation:** Two reinforcing reasons. (1) **No first-render flicker, no round-trip** — the session is delivered in the same response as the page HTML; the Client Provider hydrates with the correct initial state; users never see "Login" briefly turn into their avatar. (2) **No new BFF endpoint** — the cookie is the source of truth, RSC reads it, the Provider broadcasts it; the BFF surface stays minimal. The `router.refresh()` requirement after mid-session mutations is a small price (one line in the relevant mutation handler) for the structural benefits. Option B is rejected for the double-read-and-flicker; Option C is dominated by Option B and rejected.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-07

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **First-paint-correct** — the user sees the right outcome on the first paint, no skeleton, no flicker. (2) **Single integration pattern across both flows** — confirmation is RSC-only; reset is RSC + Client form (TD-04, TD-05 patterns reused) — both share the "RSC owns the token, Client Component owns the input" split. (3) **Email-prefetch behavior** is solved at the backend's idempotent-confirmation level (a small note for `/plan-build` to confirm; not a separate TD). Option B's Route-Handler-as-link-target adds redirects for no clean gain. Option C is dominated.
**Libraries:** —

### openapi-docs-nestjs/TD-01

**Recommendation:** **Option A (`@nestjs/swagger`)** — é a única opção que preserva as decisões anteriores (`class-validator` em TD-06 de phase-02-auth) sem re-platform; o CLI plugin com `classValidatorShim: true` aproveita os decoradores `class-validator` existentes para inferir schemas, mantendo o boilerplate baixo. Nestia tem mérito técnico real mas o custo de migração do stack de validação inviabiliza-a sem uma decisão upstream de supersede de TD-06. Manual authoring é descartado.
**Libraries:** @nestjs/swagger
**Revisions:**
- 2026-05-12 — Esclarece que o CLI plugin (`classValidatorShim: true`) cobre apenas inferência de schemas de DTOs a partir de `class-validator`; documentação de operações, respostas tipadas por status code, contratos de erro (alinhados ao envelope de phase-02-auth/TD-07) e exemplos exigem decoradores explícitos (`@ApiOperation`, `@ApiResponse`, `@ApiBody`, `@ApiParam`, `@ApiQuery`, `@ApiExtraModels`). _Rationale:_ openapi.json gerado pelo bootstrap atual está genérico — sem detalhes de parâmetros, schemas de retorno por status, nem contratos de erro — porque a base instalada se apoiou só na introspecção automática. Esta revisão fixa que enriquecimento via decoradores explícitos faz parte da Option A escolhida, não é trabalho fora do escopo do TD.

### openapi-docs-nestjs/TD-02

**Recommendation:** **Option C (Ambos)** — o custo marginal sobre Option A é apenas um npm script (~15 linhas) e o benefício é uma fundação correta para futura integração FE (codegen offline) sem perder a UI interativa que dev/QA usam. Option B sozinho pune a experiência de desenvolvimento em dev/local; Option A sozinho compromete o pipeline de codegen futuro. Combinar é dominante.
**Libraries:** —

### openapi-docs-nestjs/TD-03

**Recommendation:** **Option B (Apenas em dev/staging)** — alinha com a postura defensiva já estabelecida em phase 02 e não compromete consumidores legítimos (o `openapi.json` commitado em TD-02 cumpre o papel de "spec consultável fora da UI"). Re-abrir como Option A ou C é trivial no futuro se um caso de uso de API pública aparecer.
**Libraries:** —

### next-frontend-config-base/TD-01

**Recommendation:** **Option A (Zod 4)**. Three converging reasons: (1) **Type-inference matches the FE's strict-TS culture** — `lib/env.ts` exports a typed `env` object with no `as` casts, satisfying the project's "Type Safety" working principle. (2) **Ecosystem gravity in Next.js / React 19** — Zod is the de-facto schema language for App Router (Server Actions inputs, form resolvers, future contract validation), so introducing it once at the env layer compounds value for forms in Phase 02+. (3) **Direct enablement of TD-02 Option A (`@t3-oss/env-nextjs`)** — t3-env's first-citizen validator. Backend parity with Joi is not load-bearing: env schemas are not shared FE↔BE (different runtimes, different key sets); two validators across two subprojects is a bounded cost.

### next-frontend-config-base/TD-02

**Recommendation:** **Option A (`@t3-oss/env-nextjs`)**. The only option that combines (i) **type-level NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix enforcement**, (ii) **runtime Proxy-based leak detection**, and (iii) **single-file, single-import-path consumer ergonomics**. Option B reaches roughly the same _structural_ outcome at higher implementation and maintenance cost, with a weaker guarantee (no prefix enforcement, no proxy). Option C is unsafe at any non-trivial team size. The marginal cost over B is one ~3KB dep — well-spent for the strongest boundary among the three.
**Libraries:** @t3-oss/env-nextjs

### next-frontend-config-base/TD-03

**Recommendation:** **Option A (Strict BFF — single server-only `API_URL`)**. Aligned with the BFF testing strategy and architectural commitment already documented in `next-frontend/CLAUDE.md` (Route Handlers as the only NestJS caller; BFF tests stub `fetch` via MSW). Eliminates CORS, eliminates public exposure of the backend URL, and produces the smallest correct foundation. Option B's `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is a future-proofing concession with no current consumer — and adding a public key later is a non-breaking change, while removing one is breaking. Option C ties a foundational decision to infra work explicitly deferred elsewhere. The Docker networking gap (how server-in-container resolves the backend) is a separate orthogonal decision, surfaced below.

## Inherited Conventions

- Backend config uses `@nestjs/config` with namespaced `registerAs(name, () => ({...}))` factories — one file per domain in `src/config/`. _(from phase 01)_
- Env variables are validated by a Joi schema in `src/config/env.validation.ts`, passed to `ConfigModule.forRoot({ validationSchema, validationOptions: { allowUnknown: true, abortEarly: false } })`. _(from phase 01)_
- Config is injected into modules via `ConfigType<typeof xxxConfig>` and `@Inject(xxxConfig.KEY)`; the same factory is importable as a plain function for non-DI contexts (e.g., TypeORM CLI). _(from phase 01)_
- `data-source.ts` loads `.env` via `import 'dotenv/config'` at the top, then imports `databaseConfig` and calls it as a plain function. _(from phase 01)_
- Database connection parameters (host, port, etc.) are sourced from a single `databaseConfig` factory — never duplicated between `AppModule` and `data-source.ts`. _(from phase 01)_
- `TypeOrmModule.forRootAsync` is used (not `forRoot`), with `imports: [ConfigModule]`, `inject: [databaseConfig.KEY]`, `useFactory` returning options including `autoLoadEntities: true`, `synchronize: false`. _(from phase 01)_

## Inherited Deferred Capabilities

| Capability | Status | Origin phase | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Telas de frontend | deferred | phase-01-configuracao-base | `next-frontend/` is not initialized in this phase; UI surfaces start in a later phase. |
| Telas de cadastro, login, confirmação de conta e recuperação de senha | deferred | phase-02-auth | `next-frontend/` is not initialized in this phase; UI surfaces start in a later phase. |
| "Confirmação de conta via e-mail com link de ativação" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — UI landing screen de-scoped 2026-05-14; FE confirmation flow (TD-07) picked up by a future phase. BE side unchanged in `phase-02-auth`. |
| "Logout" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — logout button lives inside authenticated chrome (typically Phase 04). Phase 02 still implements POST `/api/auth/logout` (BFF route handler + `session.destroy()`) so the contract is ready when the chrome lands. |
| "Recuperação de senha (destination screen / set-new-password)" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — `/forgot-password` ships this phase sending the e-mail; the reset-password destination screen is absent from Figma → link destination remains a 404 until a later phase delivers the screen via `/screen-inventory` extension run. Documented as a known gap. |
| "Telas de cadastro, login, confirmação de conta e recuperação de senha" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | a tela de confirmação da conta não será implementada nesta fase corrente, será adiada — the umbrella bullet's full coverage requires the confirmação and reset-password destination screens; both are deferred per Non-UI rows above. The 3 ship-this-phase telas (signup, login, forgot-password) are inventoried and covered by their own verbs; the umbrella bullet itself is deferred to the phase that lands the missing screens. |

## Testing Requirements

### nestjs-project

| Artifact type | Required layers |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Entity (`*.entity.ts`) | Integration: constraints, defaults, `select: false` |
| Service with branching + DB | Unit: branch logic (mock repo) + Integration: DB contract |
| Service with DB only (no branching) | Integration: DB contract |
| Service with configured lib (JWT, cache) | Unit: real lib with test config |
| Service with side-effect dep (email, storage) | Integration: real capture service (Mailpit) or local adapter |
| Module with configured imports | Unit: compilation test |
| Controller | E2E only — do NOT write unit tests |
| DTO | E2E: one validation wiring test per endpoint |
| Guard (delegates to service for business logic) | E2E + Unit if complex internal logic |
| Guard (simple, delegates to Passport) | E2E only |
| Strategy (Passport) | E2E via guard |
| Pipe (custom transformation/validation) | Unit |
| Interceptor (response transform, logging) | Unit and/or E2E |
| Exception Filter | Unit + E2E |
| Middleware | E2E |

_Guide notes relevant to this phase: queue publishing and storage uploads are listed as service-to-external-system contracts worth testing (§2); `BullModule.registerQueue()` modules need compilation tests (§2); external-system strategies (storage, queue) live in `references/external-systems.md`, and anticipated types not yet in the project (e.g., queue processors) in `artifacts/future-types.md`._
